# Furniture Reformers

Furniture Reformers is an all in one application with the objective of getting used Furniture off the streets and into the hands of people who need it. 

## Furniture Reformers: What is it?

The application uses the power of generative AI and computer vision to help people with all of their furniture needs whether it is replacing it or refurbishing it. We want to get furniture out of the landfill and side of the streets to prevent waste. The tools of the website are very user friendly for everyone to use. 

## Why Furniture Reformers? 

The project originally stemmed from the observation of seeing old and unused furniture on the side of the road around the city. We thought that there could be a better way to get the furniture into better use or just off the streets in general. After this we came up with our persona of a college student who does not have access to new and expensive furniture that everyone else has. So hence the idea of furniture reformers which would be an application to get furniture either refurbished or off the streets. 

Our app lets users:
- Pick the type of furniture they would like to obtain and different ways to do so.
- Choose the type of furniture they want to get rid of depending on the size of it and the location they are in.
- Determine their furniture condition and then use AI to determine how to fix it or not.

## Our Solution

The all in one app is meant to adress all three of these growing issues. It keeps the neighborhood and cities looking clean and afforable furniture into the hands of people who need it. By using generative AI it will help to equip each user with the knowledge that they need. 

Our prototype aims to:

1. Acquiring Furniture:
   - User-Friendly: It can be able to be used by anyone whether they are tech savvy or not. 
   - Interactive: Depending on the type of furniture chosen, a user will be provided with text generation and an interactive map so they can find what they are looking for.
   
2. Dispose Furniture:
   - User-Friendly: It can be able to be used by anyone whether they are tech savvy or not. 
   - Interactive: Depending on if you would want to just get rid of or sell furniture, you are able to be provided with many resources on where to go and how to go about it.

3. Extend Furniture Lifespan:
   - Image Recognition: Integrating computer vision, the application analyzes uploaded furniture images to determine their condition and create a lesson plan. 
   - User-Friendly: The feature is user frriendly as you simply just upload a image of the piece of furniture you are trying to fix and using AI it will determine the next steps going foward or if you are better off dispsoing of it. 


Our ethic goals:

The value it offers to addressing social issues is that it creates more sustainable cities by getting the debris off the streets, reduced inequalities by offering more affordable furniture options, and responsible consumption as it can reduce the amount of landfill waste.
